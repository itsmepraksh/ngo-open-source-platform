2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following services:
   - **Authentication** (Email/Password)
   - **Firestore Database**

### 2. Firebase Configuration

1. In your Firebase project, go to Project Settings
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click "Add app" and select Web
4. Register your app and copy the configuration
5. Replace the Firebase config in the following files:
   - `admin.js` (line 2-8)
   - `login.html` (line 200-206)

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 3. Firestore Database Rules

Set up the following security rules in your Firestore Database:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write website settings
    match /website/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage projects
    match /projects/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage events
    match /events/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to manage products
    match /products/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to website content
    match /website/settings {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow public write access for volunteer applications
    match /volunteers/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow public write access for donations
    match /donations/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Image Management
